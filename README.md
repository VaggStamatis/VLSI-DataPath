# VLSI DATA PATH 
This project contains a Simple Data Path created on OrCAD. 

# Project Data 
Using the basic architecture of transistor we created 
- 2 NOT Gates 
- XOR Gate 
- PASS GATE
- MUX 2-1
- LATCH 
- FLIP FLOP 
- FULL ADDER 
- 4byte MUX 2-1
- 4byte RCA 
- 4byte SHIFTER
- 4byte SHIFTEREG
To be later combined into a simple Fully Working Data Path 

## VLSI 
Created for the LAB part of the lesson VLSI for the Undergraduate studies at Computer Science and Engineerig at University of Ioannina
